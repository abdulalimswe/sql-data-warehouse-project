DDL Script: Create Gold Layer Views
===============================================================================

Purpose:
    This script defines and creates views within the 'gold' schema of the data warehouse. 
    The 'gold' layer represents the final, business-ready presentation layer 
    based on a Star Schema design, including dimension and fact views.

Description:
    - Each view aggregates, joins, or transforms data from the 'silver' layer.
    - The output is clean, enriched, and optimized for analytics, BI, and reporting tools.

Usage:
    - Run this script to initialize or refresh the gold views after the silver layer is updated.
    - These views are intended for consumption by end-users, analysts, and dashboard tools.

Note:
    - Ensure the silver layer is populated and updated before executing this script.
    - Views do not store data; they reflect the most current data from the silver layer.
